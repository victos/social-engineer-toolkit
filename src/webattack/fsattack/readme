Hello.. I added two types of attacks XSS FullScreen ( using js ) and just Regular FullScreen Attacks.
The second can be expanded by adding different types or a custom option as the first option. If you desire this id be willing
to add more or if you wish to take this and build off it i would better appreciate that also.I had to sort of 
cut this project short because of my own work and other projects. I wanted to contribute something
because i enjoyed learning from SET and wanted to give something back. Hopefully you guys will eventually
expand on this and end up adding it to set ur free to do whatever you want with the code its open source
100% and i am giving it to you enjoy  do what you want with the code. i wrote the javascript for xss (header.js) myself
along with the PHP code for the regular fullscreen attacks obviously along with all of fsattack.py module.  :D - darko
